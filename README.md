## Task 1: Music Player app

This app contains all the functionality described in the task. But I don't listen to music, so I provided 5 Surah as media asset. For this app, I took help from AI only to design a good looking UI and generated polished buttons' xml.

## Task 2: Sensor Data

This app shows a list of all available sensors in the device and clicking one list tile will show the values of that sensor. As this app didn't require any good looking UI, so I didn't design any layout or UI resource. I just used kotlin's Jetpack Compose libraries to build the minimalist UI. Here I used SensorManager to fetch sensor list and sensor values.

## Task 3: Blog on Task 2

Please read the task3.md where I described how a developer can read sensor's data.
